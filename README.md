# ThunderCLRHost
A sister project for Thunder that exposes CLR hosting functionality

## Todo:
1. Finish implementing the core functionality.
2. Add exception handling and more error handling.
3. Research and develop a better way to detect and use the correct (and perhaps latest?) CLR per process.
4. Add functionality to support loading multiple runtimes into a process.
